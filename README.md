# Calling web APIs in a daemon or long-running process

In this sample a Windows console application calls a web API using its app identity.  This scenario is useful for situations where headless or unattended job or process needs to run as an application identity, instead of as a user's identity.  The application uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to get a token from Azure AD using the OAuth 2.0 client credential flow, where the client credential is a password.

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

## How To Run This Sample

To run this sample you will need:
- Visual Studio 2013
- An Internet connection
- An Azure subscription (a free trial is sufficient)

Every Azure subscription has an associated Azure Active Directory tenant.  If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can get a free subscription by signing up at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).  All of the Azure AD features used by this sample are available free of charge.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon.git`

### Step 2:  Create a user account in your Azure Active Directory tenant

If you already have a user account in your Azure Active Directory tenant, you can skip to the next step.  This sample will not work with a Microsoft account, so if you signed in to the Azure portal with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.  If you create an account and want to use it to sign-in to the Azure portal, don't forget to add the user account as a co-administrator of your Azure subscription.

### Step 3:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample.  Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the TodoListService web API

1. Sign in to the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click on Active Directory in the left hand nav.
3. Click the directory tenant where you wish to register the sample application.
4. Click the Applications tab.
5. In the drawer, click Add.
6. Click "Add an application my organization is developing".
7. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example "TodoListService", select "Web Application and/or Web API", and click next.
8. For the sign-on URL, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44321`.
9. For the App ID URI, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant.  Click OK to complete the registration.

#### Register the TodoListDaemon app

1. Sign in to the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click on Active Directory in the left hand nav.
3. Click the directory tenant where you wish to register the sample application.
4. Click the Applications tab.
5. In the drawer, click Add.
6. Click "Add an application my organization is developing".
7. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example "TodoListDaemon", select "Web Application and/or Web API", and click next.
8. Since this application is a daemon and not a web application, it doesn't have a sign-in URL or app ID URI.  For these two fields, enter "http://TodoListDaemon".
9. While still in the Azure portal, click the Configure tab of your application.
10. Find the Client ID value and copy it aside, you will need this later when configuring your application.
11. Create a new key for the application.  Save the configuration so you can view the key value.  Save this aside for when you configure the project in Visual Studio.
12. In "Permissions to Other Applications", click "Add Application." Select "Other" in the "Show" dropdown, and click the upper check mark. Locate & click on the TodoListService, and click the bottom check mark to add the application. Select "Access TodoListService" from the "Delegated Permissions" dropdown, and save the configuration.

### Step 4:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

#### Configure the TodoListService project

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2013.
2. Open the `web.config` file.
3. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
4. Find the app key `ida:Audience` and replace the value with the App ID URI you registered earlier, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.

#### Configure the TodoListDaemon project

1. Open `app.config'.
2. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
3. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListDaemon from the Azure portal.
4. Find the app key `ida:AppKey` and replace the value with the key for the TodoListDaemon from the Azure portal.
5. Find the app key `todo:TodoListResourceId` and replace the value with the  App ID URI of the TodoListService, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`
6. Find the app key `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the value with the base address of the TodoListService project.

### Step 5:  Trust the IIS Express SSL certificate

Since the web API is SSL protected, the client of the API (the web app) will refuse the SSL connection to the web API unless it trusts the API's SSL certificate.  Use the following steps in Windows Powershell to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate.  You only need to do this once.  If you fail to do this step, calls to the TodoListService will always throw an unhandled exception where the inner exception message is:

"The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel."

To configure your computer to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate, begin by opening a Windows Powershell command window as Administrator.

Query your personal certificate store to find the thumbprint of the certificate for `CN=localhost`:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\My


    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\My


Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042  CN=localhost
```

Next, add the certificate to the Trusted Root store:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> $cert = (get-item cert:\LocalMachine\My\C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store = (get-item cert:\Localmachine\Root)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Open("ReadWrite")
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Add($cert)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Close()
```

You can verify the certificate is in the Trusted Root store by running this command:

`PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\Root`

### Step 6:  Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

The daemon will add items to its To Do list and then read them back.

## How To Recreate This Sample

First, in Visual Studio 2013 create an empty solution to host the  projects.  Then, follow these steps to create each project.

### Creating the TodoListService Project

1. In the solution, create a new ASP.Net MVC web API project called TodoListService and while creating the project, click the Change Authentication button, select Organizational Accounts, Cloud - Single Organization, enter the name of your Azure AD tenant, and set the Access Level to Single Sign On.  You will be prompted to sign-in to your Azure AD tenant.  NOTE:  You must sign-in with a user that is in the tenant; you cannot, during this step, sign-in with a Microsoft account.
2. In the `Models` folder add a new class called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the implementation of TodoItem from this sample into the class.
3. Add a new, empty, Web API 2 controller called `TodoListController`.
4. Copy the implementation of the TodoListController from this sample into the controller.  Don't forget to add the `[Authorize]` attribute to the class.
5. In `TodoListController` resolving missing references by adding `using` statements for `System.Collections.Concurrent`, `TodoListService.Models`, `System.Security.Claims`.

### Creating the TodoListDaemon Project

1. In the solution, create a new Windows --> Console Application called TodoListDaemon.
2. Add the (stable) Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, version 1.0.3 (or higher) to the project.
3. Add  assembly references to `System.Net.Http`, `System.Web.Extensions`, and `System.Configuration`.
4. Add a new class to the project called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
5. Copy the code from `Program.cs` in the sample project into the file of same name in the new project, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
6. In `app.config` create keys for `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientId`, `ida:AppKey`, `todo:TodoListResourceId`, and `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and set them accordingly.  For the public Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.windows.net/{0}`.

Finally, in the properties of the solution itself, set both projects as startup projects.
